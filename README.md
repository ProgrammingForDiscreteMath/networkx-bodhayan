# Lecture material on NetworkX and assignment on analysis of real networks using NetworkX

## In this repository, I share the Jupyter notebooks from my lectures on Nov 20 and 22, 2017. These are contained in:
- NetworkXLecture1.ipynb
- NetworkXLecture2.ipynb

## Please note that NetworkX has an excellent documentation online (https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/index.html) which you may consult for additional functions.

## For practice, I would like to suggest the following simple problems:

### Question 1: Consider the Euro road network which you may obtain from: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/subelj_euroroad. This is an undirected network of 1174 nodes and 1417 edges. For this network, compute using networkx:
- (a) Degree distribution
- (b) Number of connected components
- (c) Average clustering coefficient
- (d) Average shortest path length
- (e) Assortativity coefficient

### Question 2: Consider the citation network of high energy physicists which you may obtain from: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/cit-HepPh. This is an directed network of 34546 nodes and 421578 edges. For this network, compute using networkx:
- (a) In- and Out-degree distribution
- (b) Number of strong connected components
- (c) Average clustering coefficient of the underlying undirected network
- (d) Average shortest path length
